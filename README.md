## Getting Started

Run the following two commands to install Xcode's command line tools and bundler, if you don't have that yet.

```bash
[sudo] gem install bundler
xcode-select --install
```

The following commands will clone the repo and install all the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-iOS.git
cd home-assistant-iOS
bundle install
pod install --repo-update
bundle exec pod install
```

Now you can open `HomeAssistant.xcworkspace` and run the `HomeAssistant` target onto your simulator or iOS device.

## Code style

This project will follow the [GitHub Swift Styleguide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide) in every way possible.

In order to enforce this, the project will also have a [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) build phase to run the linter everytime the app is built.

## Project Structure

To keep the Xcode layout mirrored with on-disk layout we're using [Synx](https://github.com/venmo/synx).

## Continuous Integration

We are using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/home-assistant/home-assistant-iOS) alongside [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to perform continuous integration both by unit testing and deploying to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) later on.

### Environment variables

To make sure iTunes can deploy, make sure you have them set to something similar to the following environment variables. **The values are only examples!**.

**Note:** For ENV variables to work in Xcode you to set `$ defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode UseSanitizedBuildSystemEnvironment -bool NO` and launch Xcode from the terminal. [Apple Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/8451)
